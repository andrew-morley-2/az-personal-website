# About
My own personal website - to allow others to learn more about me, my experience, and my projects. This was created as part of the Cloud Resume Challenge. Special thanks to Gwyneth Pe√±a-Siguenza for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYrBWmkfno&t=3410s">project video</a> that was used as a reference in this endeavor.
